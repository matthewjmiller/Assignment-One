# Ghost Hunting For The Beginner

## A step by step guide of how to begin ghost hunting

*By Abby Fincher*

Ghost hunting can be a great hobby to get into! Ghost hunting can seem intimidating at first, but it can be very enjoyable if you like history or like being scared. Professional ghost hunters often love looking up the history of the locations they hunt at because it tells the story of what happened all those years ago to make that place become haunted. The adrenaline rush is always a plus, which is bound to happen when roaming through dark hallways of creepy buildings. 

This short how-to is for the beginning ghost hunter, those just starting out and wanting to learn the basics before going on their first hunt. Beginning the art of ghost hunting is no small feat. It takes a lot of practice to get to the level of the professionals you see on TV, but with a little patience, you can rise to the professional level before you know it! In this how-to, we will cover what you will need, how to choose a location, why observations on ghost hunts are important, and why having fun is important while on a ghost hunt! 

### Step 1: Preparation

Preparation is key in any situation, but it is especially important when one wishes to pursue the hobby of hunting ghosts or observing paranormal activity. You never know what could happen. The following items may be helpful in your first and future ghost hunts:
1) Camera 
2) Tape recorder
3) Pen and Paper
4) Laptop
5) First Aid Kit
6) Cell Phone
7) Something to tell temperature

Bringing a camera will help you capture images of ghosts in photographs or video recordings. It is always interesting to see what you've "caught" when scrolling through the images at a later date or even later that day. A tape recorder could capture ghostly voices that may be impercetible to the human ear. Participating in a Q and A session with your potential ghost can reveal some awesome information. First, it lets you know if you have actually encountered a ghost. Second, asking questions helps you "get to know" the ghost that is in the room with you. This could help you know its name and possibly what its life was like when it was a human. Ghostly voices are sometimes difficult to decipher, but with some practice and training, you could be one of the experts in no time!
Bringing a first aid kit is important, especially if searching through warn down buildings that have rusty nails and possible trip hazards. Any cut big enough to warrant immmediate care can be primarily treated with a first aid kit, but if that cut is more of a gash, that cell phone is important. It can help you call 911 in an emergency or a friend if you need a quick getaway and your car will not start because of that vengeful spirit possessing the engine. 
We will discuss the thermometer, pen and paper, and use of a laptop in a later section.

### Step 2: Where To?

Looking up sites of possible paranormal activity is important when wondering where to start your ghost hunt. Don't begin with a high activity site - instead, start small and build your way up. Beginning in your grandparent's attic, for example, is a great place for beginners to expand their ghost hunting senses. Location is key. Deciding what type of spirit you would like to encounter is one of the first steps in deciding on which location you will go to. Lost souls, murder victims, playful spirits, angry spirits, vengeful spirits - the list goes on and on. Some very common locations to ghost hunt are insane asylums and abandoned hospitals. If you do not wish to encounter something horribly terrifying the first time around, maybe pick a location with less ominous paranormal activity...like the local graveyard.

### Step 3: Observations

Observations could be anything from a curtain blowing in a windless window or that ominous voice whispering in your ear as you walk through a hallway. Do not discount anything, and do not leave anything out. The smallest occurence could be significant. Recording your observations for future ghost hunts is key. This is where that paper and pencil come in! Recording anything you see on paper is a great way to recall things that a video camera may not have picked up. If you type faster than you can write with pencil and paper, bring that laptop along and record anything you see. 
There are certain meters ghost hunters use to help detect and observe ghosts. The most common one is something called an EMF detector. EMF stands for Electromagnetic Field. Ghosts emit an electromagnetic field, and EMF detectors, well, detect this field, and the detector will sound an alarm that resembles the sound of radio waves when something, like that ghost you're hunting, sets it off. 
The temperature around you is a great indicator of whether there is a ghost nearby. If there is a drop in air temperature, a ghost could potentially be using the heat energy from the room to try and materiaize (or manifest). This often leaves a cold spot and can indicate if a spirit is present. Carrying a digital thermometer could be incredibly helpful in determining the presence of a ghost. Using an EMF reader and thermometer together is a killer combination in searching for your ghost. 
Observations, knowing what you've seen, heard, and felt via cold zones helps you in expectations for future hunts and future encounters. 

### Step 4: Have Fun!

Don't want to go alone? (I wouldn't either). Convince a friend crazy enough to go with you! Ghost hunting alone can be rather creepy and the reassurance of a friend can make the experience, 1) more fun, and 2) less scary. Don't be afraid to play a practical joke or two while you're at it. And let us not forget that all to wonderful adrenaline rush of chasing something that scares you more than you scare it!

Ghost hunting is a skill and a hobby. Grab a flashlight and a friend and hit that road looking for those who have not passed on to the afterlife! And don't let that creepy face in the window end with the curiosity about ghosts. Go looking for them, build your skillset, and have fun!

Q) Is it possible to be possessed by a ghost?

A) It is rare, but it is possible. There are very few reported cases of possible ghost possessions. If you become a hardcore ghost hunter and are worried about being possessed, get this tattoo on your chest. It is an anti-possession symbol and will prevent any ghosts or other spirits from possessing you.
